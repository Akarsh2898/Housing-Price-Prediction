KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Decision Tree heavily favors cp (chest pain) at 20.83%
2. Random Forest distributes importance more evenly across features
3. Random Forest gives more importance to trestbps, exang, and thalach

                        N_ESTIMATORS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Random Forest Performance by Number of Trees:

Number of Trees | Test Accuracy | Status
---------------|---------------|------------------
50             |    98.54%     | Optimal ✓
100            |    98.54%     | Same
150            |    98.54%     | Same
200            |    98.54%     | Same

CONCLUSION: 50 trees is sufficient (no improvement with more trees)

================================================================================
                      WHY SAME PERFORMANCE?
================================================================================

Both models achieve identical accuracy because:

1. DATASET SIZE: 1,025 samples provides sufficient data
2. SAME DEPTH: Both use max_depth=10
3. SIMILAR SPLITS: Both use same random_state=42
4. RELATIVELY CLEAN DATA: Heart disease patterns are learnable
5. OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION: Depth 10 is already optimal

IMPLICATIONS:
- Decision Tree is simpler and faster (single tree)
- Random Forest is more robust but computationally heavier (50 trees)
- Both models have identical generalization capability
- Choice depends on deployment requirements, not accuracy

  - Faster training and prediction (single tree)
  - Lower memory usage
  - Easier to interpret (single tree structure)
  - Faster inference time
  - Less computational resources needed
  - Perfect accuracy at depth 10

✗ Disadvantages:
  - Less robust to noise
  - Can overfit more easily (though not in this case)
  - Single model vulnerability

RANDOM FOREST:

  - More robust to overfitting (ensemble)
  - Better generalization in noisy data
  - Reduces variance through averaging
  - More stable predictions

                           RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For Production Deployment:

1. USE DECISION TREE if:
   - Speed and interpretability are priorities
   - Computational resources are limited
   - Need fast real-time predictions
   - Want a single, explainable model

2. USE RANDOM FOREST if:
   - Need maximum robustness
   - Dataset has potential noise
   - Can afford computational overhead
   - Want ensemble benefits
   - Deployment environment has sufficient resources

CURRENT RESULT: Both models are identical in accuracy (98.54%)
              Decision Tree is the practical winner (simpler, faster)
              Random Forest is the theoretical winner (more robust)

FINAL VERDICT: Use Decision Tree for this specific task
               - Same accuracy
               - Simpler deployment
               - Faster inference
